"""
Main solver module for the Lazor Puzzle.

This script iteratively attempts to solve all .bff puzzle files in a specified folder using randomized block placement.
If a valid solution is found (i.e., all laser paths hit all target points), it exports the resulting grid and generates a visualization.

Modules Used:
- LazorConfig: Parses and loads puzzle configuration from .bff file.
- GridBuilder: Generates and manages the grid layout with blocks.
- LightPath: Simulates laser behavior through the grid.
- export_solution: Outputs the solved configuration to a file and image.

    Attempt to solve a Lazor puzzle using randomized block placement.

    Parameters:
        file_path (str): Path to the .bff puzzle file.
        max_trials (int): Maximum number of randomized attempts allowed before giving up.

    Returns:
        None
        - Exports solution to the 'solution' directory if successful.
        - Prints a message to console indicating success or failure.
